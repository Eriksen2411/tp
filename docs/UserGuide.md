Welcome to the user guide of **CoLAB**! Are you a university student in search of a reliable app to keep track of your school projects? Do you struggle to keep track of the many todos and deadlines for various school projects? Do you also tend to forget the various group meetings you have scheduled? You have come to the right place!

CoLAB (Collaboration Lab) is a **desktop app for students currently enrolled in a university to manage their school projects.** It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CoLAB can get your project management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. CoLAB's main features include:

- Project management
- Contacts management

With CoLAB, you can efficiently manage all your school projects through our comprehensive project management tools. We have put in a lot of time and effort into designing a user-friendly User Interface (UI) such that CoLAB remains intuitive to both first-time users and seasoned ones. We look forward to seeing what you accomplish with CoLAB with a clean and inviting UI. What are you waiting for? Get your journey started with the [Quick Start section](#3quick-start)!

### 2.2 Reading this Document

This subsection serves to provide explanations on the symbols, syntax and technical terms used throughout this User Guide. Familiarising yourself with this subsection will make the User Guide easier to read.

![App Window Sections](images/app_window_sections.png)

#### 2.2.2 Special Formats

[TODO]

#### 2.2.3 Command Format

Commands shown in this user guide follow these rules.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addC n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addC n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
